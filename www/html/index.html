<p><b>About me:</b><br>My name is oscar thompson. I am passionate about working with computers, both hardware and software.
 My experience includes fixing broken computers, configuring servers, and basic Python programming. I have worked 
 in the school IT department where I handled tasks such as setting up iPads for new students and repairing netbooks.
Currently, I am pursuing an access diploma in Computing, which has deepened my interest in a career in IT.
 I enjoy web development, networking, and programming, and have developed strong time management, academic writing, 
 data analysis, and research skills.<br><br>
I am a team player and a member of the M2 team at Falmouth Hockey Club. I have also participated in the 'Green Car Project,'
 rebuilding a sustainable race car. As an active Sea Cadet, I enjoy piping and competing at the regional level. My leadership skills are demonstrated through my responsibilities as a coxswain and teaching cadets from multiple units.
Through my involvement in community parades and national events, I have developed a sense of responsibility and 
leadership. I have achieved various certifications, including basic and advanced first aid, sailing, powerboating, and 
computer hardware skills.<br><br>
My work experience includes supporting IT troubleshooting at Penryn College, setting up servers and networks at microcomms, 
and working as a kitchen porter. I am committed to pursuing a career in IT and aspire to make significant contributions to
 the industry and the world. I also have 2 dogs.<br>
