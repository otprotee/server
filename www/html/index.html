<p>About me: <br>My name is oscar thompson. I am passionate about working with computers, both hardware and software.
 My experience includes fixing broken computers, configuring servers, and basic Python programming. I have worked 
 in the school IT department where I handled tasks such as setting up iPads for new students and repairing netbooks.
Currently, I am pursuing an access diploma in Computing, which has deepened my interest in a career in IT.
 I enjoy web development, networking, and programming, and have developed strong time management, academic writing, 
 data analysis, and research skills.
I am a team player and a member of the M2 team at Falmouth Hockey Club. I have also participated in the 'Green Car Project,'
 rebuilding a sustainable race car. As an active Sea Cadet, I enjoy piping and competing at the regional level. My leadership skills are demonstrated through my responsibilities as a coxswain and teaching cadets from multiple units.
Through my involvement in community parades and national events, I have developed a sense of responsibility and 
leadership. I have achieved various certifications, including basic and advanced first aid, sailing, powerboating, and 
computer hardware skills.
My work experience includes supporting IT troubleshooting at Penryn College, setting up servers and networks at Microcomms, 
and working as a kitchen porter. I am committed to pursuing a career in IT and aspire to make significant contributions to
 the industry and the world.<br>
