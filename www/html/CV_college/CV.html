I enjoy working with computers, both hardware and software. I fix broken computers 
and enjoy working with some servers I acquired. I enjoy working with software like 
Python programming at a very basic level or simply configuring servers, also at a
 basic level. I have worked in the school IT department as a paid member of staff 
 as well as a volunteer, working to wipe, set up, and sign into apps for the new 
 year 7 iPad removing the data from the previous year 11, as well as doing some 
 work repairing netbooks.<p>
I am a team player and a member of the M2 team at Falmouth Hockey Club. I have also 
enjoyed working on the ‘Green Car Project,’ rebuilding a sustainable race car during 
breaks and lunchtimes at school. I am an active participant in Sea Cadets and particularly 
enjoy piping and competing at the regional level. I am reliable, punctual, and mature. 
I can travel independently and am available to work throughout the year.<p>
In my GCSE exams, I achieved a grade 5 in English Literature and Math; a grade 6 
in Computer Science, English Language, and Combined Science; and a grade 7 in Engineering 
and Religious Education. I chose to take the GCSE in RE a year earlier (Year 10). 
Through cadets, I am an active member of community parades, marching through Falmouth 
and Penryn in remembrance, and also take part in national parades like Armed Forces Day. 
I portray leadership skills as a Sea Cadet; I take on responsibilities, including coxswain
, and have taught a large proportion of cadets from two units (Falmouth and Truro). I also 
lead a squad in drill training and unit cleaning activities.<p>
Through cadets, I have achieved the rank of Cadet First Class, two years good conduct, 
basic navigation, basic seamanship, intermediate seamanship, competent crew rowing, supervised
 coxswain, basic sailing (RYA sailing level 1), level 2 sailing (RYA sailing level 2), basic
 piping, advanced piping, basic first aid (SJA), and Cornwall District Piping Champion, level 2 
 powerboating(RYA powerboating level 2 plaining and displacement). Furthermore, I have achieved
 a computer hardware basic, python essentials 1 and using computer and mobile devices all three 
 are associated to Cisco.<p>
Through my employment and work experience placements I have gained a wide range of transferable 
skills that will support me in my higher education studies this includes work for Penryn 
College repairing incoming Year 11 iPads and resetting them for each incoming Year 7 student. 
I also completed as part of my work experience supporting staff and students with IT 
troubleshooting. Additionally, I supported a Computer Science Year 10 class. As well as the 
work experience Penryn college I worked at Microcomms. I set up a server connected to Star Link,
 made a small network, and created different class folders which were access control. I have 
 also worked as a kitchen porter at a fish and chip shop preparing food for specific orders, 
 washed up, and carried out end-of-shift cleaning activities.<p>
Perusing a career in IT is my goal I am personally interested in the fast pace and constantly 
innovative industry that is impacting the world in a positive way. I wish to be a prominent part
 of this industry and hope to one day contribute greatly to IT industry and the world as a whole.
